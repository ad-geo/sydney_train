# What can opal tap-on/tap-off data tell us?
An Udacity project for the Data Science Nanodegree Course

## Motivation
The purpose of this project is to analyze opal tap-on/tap-off data and answer the following questions:
1. Which train line has the highest annual trips?
2. What are the proportions of full, reduced and free fare trips in each train line?
3. What is the impact of Covid-19 on the number of trips made on the train lines?

## Key Libraries
Following libraries are used in python 3.6
- numpy                `import numpy as np`
- pandas               `import pandas as pd`
- matplotlib.pyplot    `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`
- seaborn              `import seaborn as sns`
